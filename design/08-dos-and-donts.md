## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.brand-yellow}` for the wordmark, top promo banner, and "yellow tag" chips
- Use `{colors.primary}` (black) as the dominant CTA on all surfaces
- Pair pastel feature cards (yellow, rose, coral, teal) with white feature cards in the same viewport
- Apply `{rounded.full}` to every button, every pill tab, every status badge
- Apply `{rounded.xxxl}` (28px) to pastel feature cards
- Use real Miro-board mockups as feature illustrations
- Treat support chat as a product-board mockup: white canvas, toolbar chrome, grid background, pastel sticky notes, and black primary controls
- Keep support bot implementation hooks stable (`#chat`, `#input`, `#tooltip`, `.message`, `.bot`, `.user`, `send()`)
- Maintain Roobert PRO across every UI surface

### Don't
- Don't use `{colors.brand-yellow}` on standard CTAs or large background surfaces
- Don't introduce additional accent colors beyond yellow + brand pastels
- Don't use gradient chat headers or decorative icon wallpaper on the support bot surface
- Don't use yellow for the support bot send button; reserve black for the primary action
- Don't soften corners on buttons; the pill is a brand signature
- Don't reduce hero leading below 1.05
- Don't apply heavy shadows on flat documentation cards; reserve elevation for whiteboard mockups
- Don't use stock photography — show the live product board UI
