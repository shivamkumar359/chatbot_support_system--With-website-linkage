## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile (small) | < 480px | Single column. Hero scales to 36px. Pill nav collapses to hamburger. Pricing tiers stack 1-up. |
| Mobile (large) | 480 – 767px | Feature tiles 2-up. Hero scales to 48px. |
| Tablet | 768 – 1023px | 2-column feature grids. Pill-tab nav returns. |
| Desktop | 1024 – 1279px | 4-tier pricing card row. Customer story grid 2-up. Hero at 64px. |
| Wide Desktop | ≥ 1280px | Full hero presentation, 80px hero display. |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons render at 40–44px effective height — at WCAG AAA floor
- Circular icon buttons: 36×36px desktop → 44×44px mobile
- Form inputs render at 44px height
- Support composer input and circular send button both render at 44px height
- Filter dropdowns render at ~36px tall — bumps to 44px on mobile

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Promo banner** stays full-width; truncates at < 480px
- **Top nav** below 1024px collapses to hamburger
- **Hero band**: 2-column hero collapses to stacked at < 1024px
- **Support assistant workspace**: 2-column hero + bot card collapses to stacked below 1120px; the live bot card appears first on tablet and mobile
- **Support floating sticky notes**: visible on desktop, hidden below 768px to protect chat readability
- **Pricing comparison**: 4-column tiers → 2-column tablet → 1-column mobile; comparison table becomes horizontal-scroll
- **Customer story grid**: 2-up → 1-up at < 768px
- **Hero typography**: 80px → 60px tablet → 48px mobile-large → 36px mobile-small
- **Footer**: 6-column desktop → 3-column tablet → 2-column mobile → accordion at small mobile

### Image Behavior
- Whiteboard mockups maintain aspect ratio; lazy-loaded below the fold
- Customer story photography uses 16:9 ratio with full-bleed scaling
- Logo wall presents wordmarks at consistent 100px height
